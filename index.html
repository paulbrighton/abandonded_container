                <h1>The Abandoned Container</h1> <!--NEEDS CHANGING-->
            
                <p>This old container is situated by the side of the road on Wentworth Terrace close to the Priory Business Park which contains a few local businesses in Fitzwilliam, Pontefract. The area is popular with dog walkers and is close to Fitzwilliam train station and Fitzwilliam Country Park. Fitzwilliam used to be a pit village where miners of the Hemsworth â€“ Fitzwilliam Colliery used to live but in recent years the pit houses have been demolished and replaced with a new housing estate.</p>
            
                <p>It seems like it is not used for anything in particular as it is pushed up against another container so the doors are not accessible. It is abandoned, surrounded by overgrown vegetation and it has been the subject of abuse by graffiti artists. It has also started to rust in places so might not be there forever. It would be a good time to sell it for scrap metal if it is no longer in use or maybe try and recycle it for another purpose.</p>
            
                <p>This container is surrounded by other shipping containers and some seem
                to be in a similar state but others look to be in quite good condition so maystill be used for storage of goods from the business park. </p>

                <h2>Where's it been?</h2>
                
                <p>There are hundreds shipping ports in the world contributing to the
                logistics of manufactured goods, many of which this container could have
                visited; this could have included Singapore, Busan or Southampton. It may
                also have been through the Panama Canal - a shortcut for ships that avoids
                the long trip around the bottom of South America. For inland waterways
                such as rivers, it is common for containers to be transported on barges,
                this is a popular way of transportation in the United States of America. </p>
                
                <p>Shipping containers are also transported over land by means of the
                road and rail network so it might have visited every corner of the United
                Kingdom before coming to rest in Fitzwilliam. Trains will transport the
                containers to regional distribution centres so they can be transferred on to
                the back of trucks to reach their final destination. </p>
                
                <p>For hard to reach places, it is possible to transport containers by air using Chinook helicopters, a popular way of transporting large objects in the military. Check out the <a href="gallery.html">Logistics Gallery.</a> </p>

                <h2>Recycling Opportunities</h2>
                
                <p>One of the most popular uses for unused containers nowadays is to build
                homes. They are good for this purpose due to their strong structure and simple and straight walls. Swimming pools, office blocks, businesses and even toilet blocks have been built using shipping containers in the past. See the <a href="gallery.html">gallery</a> for some interesting things that can be built using a shipping container. </p>
                
                <p>Some hotels such as the Holiday Inn Express in Manchester boasts 220 bedrooms and was made with shipping containers. The benefit to using containers for hotels is that they can be fitted out with all the fixtures and fittings beforehand and then transported to the site to be installed, this can make the construction of the hotels considerably cheaper than the standard way of building. </p>
                
                <p>Containers have been used in some countries to home refugees that have fled from their homeland due to conflict or famine. Some of these refugee camps are as big as a small town such as the one located in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq which houses Syrian refugees. The containers provide the refugees with more protection from the elements such as sand storms than tents would and are easier to erect than bricks and mortar buildings. Containers can also be moved to other places where they are needed when situations change. </p>
